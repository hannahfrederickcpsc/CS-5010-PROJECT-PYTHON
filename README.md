## plots/

This folder contains each graph saved as a pdf file. This folder is for personal reference and bookkeeping. 

## scrapers/

This folder contains the following three files, each containing a different webscraper. This folder also contains the corresponding csv output for each web scraper. These csv files are read in by data_cleaning.ipynb, and later condensed into complete_cleaned.csv. 

Each python file can be run individually to perform a fresh scrape and produce corresponding csv outputs.
