    "## Introduction:\n",
    "In our present historical moment, analysis and understanding of election results and patterns is of crucial importance. It's a widely-spread talking point that voter turnout is trending downwards not only across the nation, but across the liberal world, as feelings of voter efficacy wane. Further complexifying this scenario are recent attempts by state and federal government offices to manipulate voter disenfranchisement to their own political ends, begging the question of analysis of registration data as well.  \n",
    "Additionally, in 1996, Virginia implemented the [National Voter Registration (\"Motor Voter\") Act](https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-national-voter-registration-act), which allowed voter registration forms to be submitted through Department of Motor Vehicles offices and other designated agencies, or to be submitted by mail. This fundamentally simplified the issue of voter registration in Virginia, and we were interested to see if there was significant difference between pre- and post-1996 registration numbers. \n",
    "Because we all go to school at Virginia's flagship public institution of higher education, we felt it appropriate and of worth to investigate the possibility of some of these trends in our own Commonwealth.  \n",
    "As a result, we agreed early on that we wanted to examine data from the Virginia Department of Elections, though in what form we would be examining the data was unclear. We hoped to be able to bring to light some interesting results and conclusions by our querying, that perhaps had gone unnoticed or unthought of in previous examinations of the data, as well as to hone our own webscraping, data cleaning and manipulation, analysis, and deductive skills."

    "## Description of the Data:\n",
    "Our data are composed of three separate web scrapes, all from resources publicly available on the [Virginia Department of Elections website](https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/). Our first dataset was of registration/turnout reports in November general elections, from 1976-2019. Upon closer inspection, our team determined that we wanted to do deeper analysis, and chose to also web scrape general election results data from presidential and gubernatorial elections over the same period of time, from the [Department of Elections Historical Database](https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/).  \n",
    "All of these web scraped data required substantial cleaning and manipulation before it was useful to us for analysis.\n",
    "#### Describe this process here."

    "## Beyond Original Specifications:\n",
    "In order to exceed the baseline expectations for this project, our group chose to web scrape three different data sets and perform extra manipulation and cleaning to make it workable. \n",
    "#### go into more detail aobut this process again, but with an emphasis on why it merits extra credit\n",
    "Furthermore, we designed a method which would allow a user to input any year in which there was a presidential election (from 1976-2019) and check to see if Virginia voted for the eventual winner of the national general election. This was done by querying the data set against a dictionary of national election winners.\n",
    "#### insert code for this method\n",
    "Lastly, we also performed some statistical hypothesis testing, to be able to confidently affirm or reject our suspicions about the impact of presidential elections on turnout, as well as of the Motor Voter Act on registration. This required and allowed us to explore statistical computing packages in Python, an essential skill in our repertoire.\n",
    "#### insert t-test codes here"
